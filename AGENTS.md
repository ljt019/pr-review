If you want to run/test this project you are gonna have to create a git repo at '.input_codebase/' and create some code on main, switch to dev and make some changes. 

That's probably not worth the trouble unless you are unsure the code will work, in otherwords if you are confident don't waste your time going through the trouble, but if you aren't do.
