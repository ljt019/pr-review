  summary: "The codebase is a Flask-based web application with several critical security vulnerabilities, poor error handling, and performance issues. Key problems include hardcoded secrets (SECRET_KEY, SMTP credentials), weak authentication (any non-empty token passes), SQL injection risks (though currently mitigated by parameterized queries), path traversal in file import, and remote code execution via eval. The application also has performance bottlenecks like nested loops for sum of squares, lack of pagination, and cache stampede risks. Resource management issues include unhandled exceptions in email sending and no input validation on email body length.",

      title: "Hardcoded secret key in configuration",
      description: "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded in server/routes.py as 'not_so_secret_change_me', which is a critical security risk. This key is used for session management and could allow attackers to forge sessions or perform CSRF attacks.",

      title: "Remote code execution via eval",
      description: "The /unsafe_eval endpoint uses eval() on user-provided input without any sanitization, which allows arbitrary code execution. This is a critical security vulnerability that could lead to complete system compromise.",

    {
      title: "Path traversal vulnerability in file import",
      description: "The /import endpoint reads a file path from user input without validation, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server through path traversal (e.g., ../../etc/passwd).",

      title: "Weak authentication implementation",
      description: "The require_auth decorator only checks if the X-Auth header is non-empty, allowing any token to pass. This provides no real authentication and is easily bypassed.",
