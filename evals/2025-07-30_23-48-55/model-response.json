  summary: "The codebase is a Flask-based web application with multiple components including routes, authentication, database access, email services, and background tasks. Key findings include multiple security vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets, weak authentication, unsafe eval usage, and path traversal risks. There are also performance issues with inefficient algorithms and poor caching strategies. The application lacks proper error handling, logging, and input validation. Several critical security flaws exist that could lead to remote code execution, data exposure, and unauthorized access.",

      title: "Hardcoded secret key in configuration",
      description: "The Flask application uses a hardcoded SECRET_KEY value of 'not_so_secret_change_me' in routes.py, which is a critical security risk as it can be exploited to forge session cookies and gain unauthorized access.",
