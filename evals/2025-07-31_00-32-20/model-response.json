  summary: "The codebase is a Flask-based web application with several critical security vulnerabilities, poor error handling, and performance issues. Key problems include a hardcoded secret key, weak authentication, SQL injection risks (though mitigated by parameterized queries), path traversal in file imports, unsafe eval usage, and inadequate input validation. The database layer has thread-safety issues and inefficient query patterns. Caching lacks proper invalidation and has race conditions. Overall, the application is not production-ready without significant security and architectural improvements.",

    {
      title: "Hardcoded secret key in configuration",
      description: "The application uses a hardcoded SECRET_KEY value 'not_so_secret_change_me' in routes.py, which is a critical security vulnerability. This key is used for session management and could be exploited to forge sessions or perform CSRF attacks.",

      title: "Weak authentication implementation",
      description: "The require_auth decorator only checks for the presence of an X-Auth header, allowing any non-empty token to pass. This provides no real authentication and is trivial to bypass.",

      title: "Remote code execution via unsafe eval",
      description: "The /unsafe_eval endpoint uses Python's eval() function on user-provided input without any sanitization, which allows remote code execution. This is a critical security vulnerability that could lead to complete system compromise.",
