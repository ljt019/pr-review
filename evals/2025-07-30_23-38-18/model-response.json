  summary: "The codebase is a Flask-based web application with a modular structure, including routes, services, tasks, and utilities. Key issues include security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, weak auth, eval usage), performance problems (inefficient algorithms, lack of pagination), reliability concerns (unvalidated inputs, no error handling), and architectural flaws (global state, thread-unsafe code). The legacy module contains dead code, and configuration is poorly managed. Overall, the application is not production-ready without significant refactoring.",

      title: "Hardcoded secret key in Flask app",

      title: "Weak authentication with header-based token",
      description: "The require_auth decorator only checks for a non-empty X-Auth header, which means any token value (including empty strings) is accepted. This provides no real security and is easily bypassed.",
