      "summary": "Comprehensive code review of a Python codebase for a formatter tool (likely Black). The project structure is well-organized with clear separation of main functionality, tests, and documentation. Security vulnerabilities were found to be minimal as the tool processes code formatting rather than handling sensitive data. Code quality is generally high with good use of typing, dataclasses, and functional patterns. Performance issues are limited to potential bottlenecks in file parsing and formatting of large files. Error handling is robust with comprehensive exception handling, though some edge cases could be improved. Best practices are well-followed with consistent styling, proper testing, and clean architecture.",
