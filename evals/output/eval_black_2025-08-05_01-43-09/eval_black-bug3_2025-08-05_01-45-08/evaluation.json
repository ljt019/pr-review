      "summary": "The codebase is a mature Python project, Black - a popular code formatter for Python. The project structure is well-organized with clear separation of concerns between the core formatter (black.py), CLI interface, tests, documentation, and configuration. The codebase demonstrates high quality with proper use of types, modular design, and comprehensive testing. No critical security vulnerabilities were found, as the code works with code parsing and formatting rather than user input or sensitive data. The implementation is robust, with extensive type hints, comprehensive test coverage, and thorough error handling. The codebase follows Python best practices and adheres to the PEP 8 style guide, making it a model of clean, maintainable code.",
