  "summary": "The codebase is a Python package for code formatting called Black, with a well-structured architecture consisting of core formatting functionality in black.py, a web server interface in blackd.py, and extensive test coverage. The code exhibits strong security practices with no exposed secrets, proper input validation, and secure handling of user-provided data. The code quality is generally high with good use of type hints, proper error handling, and clean code organization. Performance considerations are addressed through efficient parsing and formatting algorithms. The code follows Python best practices and adheres to established coding standards.",

      "title": "Potential memory leak in blackd.py with large inputs",
      "description": "The blackd.py server handles incoming requests by reading the entire content into memory before processing, which could lead to memory exhaustion with very large files. The response shows that request.content.read() is called without any size limits.",

      "severity": "major",
      "category": "performance",
      "recommendation": "Implement streaming processing or limit the maximum request size to prevent memory exhaustion. Consider using a streaming approach or adding a maximum request size validation."

      "title": "Inconsistent error handling in blackd.py",
      "description": "The handle function in blackd.py catches Exception and returns a generic 500 error, which could expose internal server details to clients. This makes it difficult to distinguish between different types of failures for debugging.",
