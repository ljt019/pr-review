The codebase demonstrates good use of type hints, proper error handling patterns, and follows Python best practices.

The core code is well-organized with a modular design based on the lib2to3 AST manipulation. There are no detectable security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or exposed secrets, as the code operates purely on AST transformations without external database access, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The code quality is excellent with proper typing, extensive use of dataclasses, comprehensive error handling, and consistent code style. Performance is well-optimized with efficient memory usage through AST manipulation and smart caching mechanisms. The implementation demonstrates exceptional attention to detail in handling Python's complex syntax features like f-strings, type annotations, async/await syntax, and various bracket nesting scenarios.

Security vulnerabilities are minimal as this is a code formatter that doesn't process user input or sensitive data. The code demonstrates excellent error handling with specific exception types for different scenarios. The implementation includes robust testing infrastructure with reference test cases and performance benchmarking. Documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained.",
