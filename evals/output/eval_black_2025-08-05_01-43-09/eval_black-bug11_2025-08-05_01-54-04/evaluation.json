      "summary": "The codebase is a Python-based code formatter (Black) with a well-structured architecture. The core functionality is solid, with comprehensive handling of Python syntax, formatting rules, and performance optimizations. The project follows modern Python best practices with proper type hints, dependency management, and configuration via pyproject.toml. Security vulnerabilities are minimal as this is a code formatter that doesn't process user input or sensitive data. The code demonstrates excellent error handling with specific exception types for different scenarios. The implementation includes robust testing infrastructure with reference test cases and performance benchmarking. Documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained.",
