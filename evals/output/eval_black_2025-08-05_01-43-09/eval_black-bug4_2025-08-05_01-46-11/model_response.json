  "summary": "Comprehensive code review of the Black code formatter project. The codebase is well-structured and follows Python best practices with strong type hints, clean architecture, and thorough error handling. The project is a production-ready code formatter with a clear separation of concerns between the core formatter (black.py) and the web server (blackd.py). Security vulnerabilities are minimal as the code processes strings rather than executing code, though the server implementation could be hardened with additional measures. Performance is optimized through parallel processing, cache usage, and efficient parsing. The code quality is excellent with consistent style, proper documentation, and comprehensive test coverage in the test files.",

      "title": "Insecure HTTP header handling in blackd server",
      "description": "The blackd server accepts custom HTTP headers that could be exploited in a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack if combined with other services in a complex deployment. An attacker could manipulate headers like X-Python-Variant to influence parsing behavior.",

      "line": "00080",
      "severity": "critical",
      "category": "security",
      "recommendation": "Implement strict validation for X-Python-Variant header values and consider using a more secure protocol like HTTP/2 with request signing. Add rate limiting and request size limits to prevent abusive use."

      "title": "Potential memory leak in process pool executor",
      "description": "The ProcessPoolExecutor is created but never explicitly shutdown in the blackd server, which could lead to a memory leak in long-running processes. The executor is created but not properly managed in the server lifecycle.",

      "severity": "major",
      "category": "performance",
