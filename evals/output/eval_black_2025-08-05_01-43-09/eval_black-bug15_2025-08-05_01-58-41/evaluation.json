      "summary": "Comprehensive code review of a Python codebase for a code formatter tool. The project has a well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns, proper use of decorators, and comprehensive test coverage. The code follows Python best practices and is well-documented. No security vulnerabilities were found, as the tool processes code as text and doesn't handle user input that could lead to injection attacks. The code quality is high with proper typing, error handling, and maintainability. Performance is adequate for the tool's purpose, though some complex operations could be optimized. The documentation is complete and well-maintained.",
