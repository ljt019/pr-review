The codebase is extensive and complex, with a focus on parsing Python syntax trees and applying strict formatting rules. The project uses standard Python packaging tools (setuptools, pip), and follows best practices for configuration management with pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml. The codebase is well-documented with comprehensive README and documentation in the docs/ directory. The code quality is high with proper type hints, error handling, and consistent code style.",
