  "summary": "The codebase is a Python code formatter (Black) with a focus on enforcing consistent code style. The project is well-organized with clear separation of concerns. The review found no critical security vulnerabilities, as the tool processes code rather than user input or sensitive data. Code quality is generally strong with good use of type hints and structured classes. Performance is optimized with parallel processing and caching mechanisms. Error handling is comprehensive with appropriate exception types and recovery. The code adheres to Python best practices and includes thorough documentation and testing. The only notable issue is a minor anti-pattern in the test suite's `@patch` decorators, which could be improved with context managers.",
