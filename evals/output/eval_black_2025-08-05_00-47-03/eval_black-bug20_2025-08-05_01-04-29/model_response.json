  "summary": "The Black codebase is a high-quality implementation of a Python code formatter with excellent security practices, comprehensive error handling, and adherence to modern Python best practices. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, extensive documentation, and a comprehensive test suite. While there are opportunities to improve maintainability by refactoring some lengthy functions, the overall quality is exceptional.",

    {
      "title": "Long functions with high cyclomatic complexity",
      "description": "The `whitespace` function in black.py is over 250 lines long and has high cyclomatic complexity, making it difficult to maintain and test. This function could be refactored into smaller, more focused functions with clear responsibilities.",
      "file": "black.py",
      "line": "1300-1510",
      "recommendation": "Refactor the `whitespace` function into smaller, more focused functions that each handle a specific case (e.g., handling comments, handling commas, handling different parent types). This would improve maintainability and testability."

    {
      "title": "Duplicate code in delimiter prioritization functions",
      "description": "The `is_split_before_delimiter` and `is_split_after_delimiter` functions contain nearly identical logic with only minor differences in the conditions checked. This duplication increases maintenance complexity.",
      "file": "black.py",
      "line": "1531-1595",
      "recommendation": "Extract the common logic into a separate helper function and use parameterization to handle the differences between the two functions, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generic variable names in complex functions",
      "description": "The code uses generic variable names like 'v' and 'p' in functions like `whitespace`, which reduces code readability and makes it harder for new developers to understand the code.",
      "file": "black.py",
      "line": "1300-1510",
      "recommendation": "Replace generic variable names with more descriptive names that reflect the actual purpose of the variables (e.g., 'value' instead of 'v', 'parent' instead of 'p') to improve code readability."
