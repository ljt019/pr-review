      "summary": "The codebase is a Python package for the Black code formatter, a popular tool for automatic code formatting. After a comprehensive review, the codebase is found to be well-structured and free from critical security vulnerabilities. The code quality is generally high with proper use of type hints, modular design, and clear separation of concerns. The performance is optimized with efficient use of lib2to3 for parsing and formatting. Error handling is robust with comprehensive exception handling throughout. The code adheres to Python best practices and follows the standard library conventions. Minor improvements could be made in code organization and documentation, but these do not affect functionality or reliability.",
