      "summary": "The codebase is a Python code formatter called 'black' that processes Python source code. After a comprehensive review, there are no critical security vulnerabilities as the tool is designed to format code without executing it. The code has excellent error handling with proper exception types and meaningful error messages. The architecture is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Code quality is high with proper use of dataclasses, type hints, and clear function responsibilities. Performance is optimized with caching and parallel processing. The code follows Python best practices and has extensive documentation. No critical issues were found that would prevent safe operation.",
