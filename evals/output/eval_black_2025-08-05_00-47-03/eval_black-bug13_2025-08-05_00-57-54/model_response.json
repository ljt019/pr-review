  "summary": "The codebase is a sophisticated Python code formatter similar to Black. The code is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns between CLI parsing, formatting logic, and AST manipulation. No critical security vulnerabilities were found. The code quality is generally high with proper type hints and documentation, though some functions could benefit from refactoring to reduce complexity. Performance is optimized with parallel processing and intelligent caching. Error handling is comprehensive. The code follows Python best practices and integrates well with standard tooling.",
