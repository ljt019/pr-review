The project has a well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns between core formatting logic (black.py), test cases (test_black.py), and a server component (blackd.py). The codebase demonstrates strong adherence to best practices, with comprehensive unit testing, proper error handling, and efficient use of Python features like type hints and functional programming constructs. The core formatting engine uses lib2to3's AST parsing to safely manipulate Python code while preserving semantics.",
