      "summary": "The codebase is for spaCy, a popular Python library for natural language processing. The review focused on security, code quality, performance, error handling, and best practices. The analysis found no critical security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, or serious code quality issues. The code follows good practices with proper input validation, error handling, and architecture. The CLI tools are well-structured with proper argument handling. The build system and dependencies are managed appropriately. No major issues were identified that would compromise security, performance, or maintainability.",
