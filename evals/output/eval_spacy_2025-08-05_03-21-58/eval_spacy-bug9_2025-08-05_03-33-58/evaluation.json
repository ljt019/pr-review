The core functionality is implemented in Cython modules for performance, while CLI tools handle model training, conversion, and management. Key security concerns include potential code injection through dynamic model loading and unsafe deserialization of JSON data. The code quality is generally high with proper error handling and type checking, though some files have code duplication and overly complex functions. Performance is optimized through Cython usage, though there are opportunities for improvement in memory handling. The code adheres to most best practices, with a few exceptions in type hinting and function length.",
