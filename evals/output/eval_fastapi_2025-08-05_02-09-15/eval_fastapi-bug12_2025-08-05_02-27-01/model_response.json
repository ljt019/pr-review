  "summary": "The codebase appears to be a collection of tutorial examples for a FastAPI-based web framework. The code demonstrates various features like routing, request handling, security, databases, and more. While the tutorials are educational and demonstrate correct patterns, there are several issues that would prevent them from being used in production. The most critical issue is the presence of hardcoded SECRET_KEY values in tutorial files, which should never be exposed in production code. Other concerns include inconsistent error handling, code duplication, improper use of optional parameters, and missing type hints. The code quality is generally good for educational purposes but would require significant refinement for production use.",

      "description": "Multiple security tutorial files contain hardcoded SECRET_KEY values that should never be exposed in production. This key is used for JWT token signing and verification, and if compromised, could allow attackers to forge valid tokens and gain unauthorized access to the system. The key is exposed in tutorial004.py and tutorial005.py.",
