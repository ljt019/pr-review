  "summary": "The codebase appears to be a collection of tutorials for FastAPI, demonstrating various features like authentication, path operations, query parameters, and security implementations. The project structure is well-organized with tutorials grouped by functionality. The security tutorials demonstrate proper implementation of token-based authentication with OAuth2 and JWT, though some examples use weak password hashing and fake data. The code quality is generally good with proper use of Pydantic models and type hints. Performance issues are minimal in the sample code, and error handling is adequate, though some patterns could be improved. The tutorials follow FastAPI conventions and best practices, though some examples use hard-coded secrets that would be problematic in production.",

This is a critical security vulnerability as it exposes the application to potential token manipulation and authentication bypass.",

      "title": "Weak password hashing implementation",
      "description": "The tutorial003.py file uses a simple fake_hash_password function that prepends 'fakehashed' to the password, which provides no real security. This is dangerous in demonstration code as it might be copied to production without proper understanding.",
