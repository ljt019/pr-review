  "summary": "The codebase consists of FastAPI tutorial examples that demonstrate proper security practices, input validation, and error handling. The code shows no critical security vulnerabilities, with proper authentication patterns using OAuth2 and JWT. All examples follow FastAPI best practices with proper type hints, validation, and error handling. The documentation is accurate and aligns with the code. No performance issues were identified as the code focuses on demonstrating API patterns rather than production systems.",

    {
      "title": "Missing proper password hashing in tutorial",
      "description": "The tutorial uses a simple 'fakehashed' prefix for passwords, which is inadequate for production systems and could mislead developers about proper password security practices.",
      "file": "docs/src/security/tutorial003.py",
      "line": "00026-00027",
      "recommendation": "Replace the fake_password_hash function with a proper password hashing implementation using libraries like bcrypt or passlib, and add a comment explaining this is for demonstration purposes only."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lack of explicit error messages in auth flow",
      "description": "The authentication error messages are generic ('Incorrect username or password') which could be exploited to enumerate valid usernames via timing or response differences.",
      "file": "docs/src/security/tutorial003.py",
      "line": "00077-00080",
      "recommendation": "Use consistent error messages for both invalid usernames and passwords to prevent username enumeration attacks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insecure token generation in tutorial",
      "description": "The tutorial generates access tokens using only the username, which provides minimal security and could be predictable.",
      "file": "docs/src/security/tutorial003.py",
      "line": "00084",
      "recommendation": "Replace the simple token generation with a proper JWT implementation using a secure signing algorithm and include proper claims and expiration times."
    },
    {
      "title": "No rate limiting in authentication endpoints",
      "description": "The authentication endpoints are vulnerable to brute force attacks as there is no rate limiting implemented.",
      "file": "docs/src/security/tutorial003.py",
      "line": "00074-00084",
      "recommendation": "Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints using FastAPI middleware or external libraries like starlette-rate-limit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Incomplete JWT implementation in tutorial",
      "description": "The tutorial shows OAuth2 flow but doesn't implement the full JWT verification process including signature validation, expiration checks, and proper token refresh mechanisms.",
      "file": "docs/src/security/tutorial003.py",
      "line": "00050-00054",
      "recommendation": "Extend the tutorial to include a proper JWT implementation with signature verification, expiration checks, and refresh token handling."
