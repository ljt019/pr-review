      "summary": "The codebase is a FastAPI application demonstrating CRUD operations with SQLAlchemy, organized into a clean architecture with separation of concerns. The project structure is well-organized with clear separation between models, CRUD operations, schemas, and API endpoints. Key security issues include the use of fake password hashing (notreallyhashed) which is a critical vulnerability. The code also shows proper use of dependency injection and proper error handling for common cases like user not found or duplicate email registration. The application demonstrates good practices in input validation through Pydantic models and proper database transaction management. Performance is adequate for typical use cases, with efficient query patterns using offset/limit for pagination.",
