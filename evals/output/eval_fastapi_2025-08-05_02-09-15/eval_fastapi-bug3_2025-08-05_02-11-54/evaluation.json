The primary code quality issues include hardcoded secrets in the security examples, which pose a critical security risk. The authentication implementations follow FastAPI best practices with proper use of OAuth2, JWT, and HTTP Basic authentication. However, the examples contain hardcoded credentials and secrets in production-like code, which is unacceptable for real applications. The code quality is generally good with proper use of typing, error handling, and dependency injection, but the security implementations should never be used as-is in production due to the exposed secrets.",
