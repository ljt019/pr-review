Reads a file from the workspace. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files in the workspace. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- Use relative paths from the workspace root (e.g., "src/main.py", "app.py", "server/auth.py")
- The tool automatically works from the /workspace directory context
- By default, it outputs up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents
