- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.py" or "src/**/*.ts"
- The path parameter defaults to "." (workspace root) - use relative paths like "src" or "tests"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful
