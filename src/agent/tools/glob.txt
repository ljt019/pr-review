Fast file pattern matching tool for finding files by name patterns. Use this when you need to locate files that match specific naming conventions or extensions across the codebase.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool when you need to:
- Find files with specific extensions (e.g., all Python files, config files)
- Locate files following naming patterns (e.g., test files, migration files)
- Search for files in specific directories with pattern matching
- Get a quick overview of file types in the codebase

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Don't use this tool when:
- You know the exact file path (use read_file directly)
- You need to search file contents (use grep instead)
- You want to list all files in a directory (use list_dir instead)

## Examples

**Find all Python files:**
```json
{"pattern": "**/*.py"}
```

**Find test files:**
```json
{"pattern": "**/test_*.py"}
```

**Find config files in specific directory:**
```json
{"pattern": "*.json", "path": "config/"}
```

**Find JavaScript/TypeScript files:**
```json
{"pattern": "**/*.{js,ts}"}
```

Results are sorted by modification time (newest first) and limited to 50 files to keep output manageable.
