Searches file contents using patterns and regex.
Examples: grep "TODO", grep "function.*login" src, grep "import.*axios" --include="*.js".
Pattern is optional - if omitted, searches for all files (defaults to ".").
Returns paths of files containing matches, sorted by modification time.
Supports full regex syntax and file filtering with include parameter.
