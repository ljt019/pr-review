Lists files and directories in a hierarchical tree structure. Automatically filters out common development directories (node_modules, .git, __pycache__, etc.) to focus on relevant code. Use this to understand project structure and navigate large codebases efficiently.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool when you need to:
- Get an overview of project structure and organization
- Understand how code is organized across directories
- Find the main source directories before detailed analysis
- Navigate unfamiliar codebases

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Don't use this tool when:
- You need to find specific files by pattern (use glob instead)
- You want to search file contents (use grep instead)
- You know the exact file path you need (use read_file directly)

Results are limited to 100 files and show a clean tree structure with irrelevant directories automatically filtered out.
