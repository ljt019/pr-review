Lists files and directories in a given path within the workspace.
Use relative paths from the workspace root (e.g., ".", "src", "server/routes").
It defaults to the workspace root if no path parameter is specified or if you use ".".
You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter.
You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools if you know which directories to search.
