I've received a codebase for review. Please perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:

1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Check for SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, exposed secrets, improper input validation
2. **Code quality** - Identify code smells, anti-patterns, complexity issues, and maintainability concerns
3. **Performance issues** - Look for inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, unnecessary operations
4. **Error handling** - Review exception handling, edge cases, and error recovery mechanisms
5. **Best practices** - Verify adherence to language-specific conventions and industry standards

Start by analyzing the overall project structure and architecture, then dive into specific modules. Prioritize critical security issues and bugs that could cause system failures.

Remember: Create a comprehensive todo list for your review and ensure ALL todos are marked as complete before providing your final JSON review.
Please remember to provide your findings in the structured JSON format once your analysis is complete.
