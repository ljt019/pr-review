Read file contents with line numbers and intelligent pagination. Essential for examining source code, configuration files, and documentation to understand implementation and find bugs.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool when you need to:
- Examine source code files for bugs and security issues
- Read configuration files, manifests, and documentation
- Analyze specific sections of large files
- Understand code implementation and logic flow

## Features

- **Line numbering**: Every line is numbered for easy reference
- **Smart pagination**: Read large files in manageable chunks using offset/limit
- **Binary file detection**: Automatically rejects binary files with helpful messages
- **File suggestions**: When file not found, suggests similar filenames
- **Line truncation**: Very long lines are truncated to keep output readable

## Usage

**Read entire file:**
```json
{"filePath": "src/app.py"}
```

**Read specific section:**
```json
{"filePath": "src/app.py", "offset": 50, "limit": 30}
```

Files are displayed with line numbers in format: `00001| content`. For large files, use offset/limit to read specific sections.
