CRITICAL: 
DO NOT CREATE ANY TODOS BEFORE YOU HAVE COMPLETED STEPS 1-4 
DO NOT READ ANY CODE FILES BEFORE YOU HAVE COMPLETED STEPS 1-4
YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL TODOS BEFORE YOU PROVIDE A REVIEW

PROCESS - YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL STEPS:
1. List the root directory structure
2. List the structure of any major directories
3. Read key files like README.md, pyproject.toml, project.json, etc.
4. Create a initial todo list based on your findings to keep track of your analysis progress

From here, you can use any of your tools to throughly review the codebase.
Explore any important files, directories, and code. 
The more files you read, the better your analysis can be, so be thorough!!

Don't forget to use grep to more easily find patterns in the code.
Don't forget to add, update, and complete todos as needed as you go.
Complete all your todos before you provide a review.
Update completed todos as soon as you complete them, don't leave them as incomplete until the end.
